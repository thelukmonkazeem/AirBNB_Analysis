# AirBNB_Analysis
An end to end analysis of AirBNB in New York in 2019 using Python, Power BI and SQL.

**Project Introduction:**

Listing is simply the advertisement of properties for the sole aim of rent and sale. 

And, AirBNB is a American based vacation rentage company that was established in 2008 to allow property owners, known as Host to rent out their property (home, entire apartment, and room) for individuals looking for where to stay or lodge.

In this project, I used Python, Power BI and SQL to analyze the AirBNB dataset.

The dataset can be found here. ![Air BNB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
